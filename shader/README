Description:
       For the specular components implementation, the half-way vector is used instead of reflection vector. The Blinn-Phong shading effect of each pixels is calculated using equation:
      color = ka Ia + kd Id (n · ℓ) + ks Is (n · h)^s
the dot products of diffuse factor and specular factor in equation is replaced with a texture mapping to given textures.
