Description:
    The linking of box2D objects and openGL is enabled by creating of same
shapes in both environment. The box2D will handle the physics simulations
and the graph of which is updated by redraw the shape in the returned position.

    The definition of box2D objects are handled in shape.hpp file, and the
position, angle value and pointer to box2D circle / box object is returned
to be used in main program, in order to update the frame. The rotation of object
is handled in draw.cpp by passing additional angle values into it.
