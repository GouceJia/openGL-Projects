CSci4611 - Assignment 4
(fangx174 / 5094239)

	In this assignment, the character is draw by the character and bone
class drawing function. The character::draw() is simply apply the current 
transformation matrix to the coordinate system and using a for loop to
draw the bones attached to the root node. Drawing of the other parts of 
the body is handled by the recursive function calls within bone::draw().
	bone::draw() is applying and popping transformation matrix to draw the
current bone in right position (the construction of rotation matrix is
implemented using method b in the handout), and the starting points is then
moved to the endpoints of current bone, and calling itself recursively on
the children of this bone.

	The spline line is implemented using the given formula in class slide, 
with problem specific scaling. Basic idea is to find the two control 
points which current time frame is in between, and evaluate the position
and derivatives.

	Finally, to make the person walk on the spline line, the root node is
translated to the position returned by spline::getValue(). Also to make him
facing right, the z_axis of coordinate system is rotated to meet the
derivative value returned by spline::getDerivative(). The velocity is
proportional to value of (dt*curVelocity*0.23/baseVelocity), where curVelocity
is length of spline::getDerivative() and baseVelocity is the length of original
velocity vector.
