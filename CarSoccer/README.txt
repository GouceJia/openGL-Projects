Project Implementation:
	The gravity used is -9.8, and soccer / car will bounce off the wall,
although sometimes with a very large velocity, the edge of the object will
be out of bound for a short while.

	The way I handle car-wall and ball-way collision is to flip the car / ball
velocity vector by the normal of wall it collide with using -2(dÂ·n)*n. Also I
have the special case for the car hit the ground corners, and handled them same as
the case bouncing back with respect to front / back wall.

	The way I used for "bouncing off" in the car-ball collision case is to
make the ball move far away along the collision-normal until the car and the
ball is no more intersecting. 

	Turning the car with left / right arrow key is handled through maintaining
a speed and angle value in car class, and updated the angle and speed if arrow
keys are hit. Then calculate the velocity vector based on the angle and speed values.
